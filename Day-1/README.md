**Web is a collection of websites connected through the Internet.**

We open the web using a browser like Chrome or Edge.

Web allows users to:
- Read information
- Fill forms
- Watch videos
- Use applications (Gmail, WhatsApp Web)

Examples: Google, YouTube, Amazon

**A website is a collection of web pages. Each web page is written using HTML.**

Websites can be:
- Static: Only show information
- Dynamic: User interaction like login and forms

Web development means building websites or web applications.

**It has three main parts:**
- Frontend: What users see
- Backend: Logic and server
- Database: Stores data

**In this course, we focus on Frontend.**

- HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

- HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.

- HTML tells the browser what to show on the page.

- HTML is NOT a programming language. HTML is a markup language.

**How Browser Works (High Level):**
1. User types a URL
2. Browser sends request to server
3. Server sends HTML, CSS, JS
4. Browser reads HTML
5. Browser applies CSS
6. Browser runs JavaScript
7. Page is shown to the user

HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript:
HTML: Structure
CSS: Styling
JavaScript: Logic

Real-life analogy:
HTML is Body
CSS is Clothes
JavaScript is Brain
