**Every HTML page follows a fixed structure.**

**This structure helps the browser:**

- Understand the page
- Render it correctly
- Follow web standards

Think of it like:
House plan → foundation, rooms, roof
HTML → doctype, html, head, body

**Why Document Structure is Important:**

- Browser knows which version of HTML to use
- Search engines understand your page better
- Avoids unexpected layout or rendering issues
- Industry-standard way of writing HTML

**Main Parts of HTML Document:**

!DOCTYPE html: Tells browser this page uses HTML5

- html: Root element that contains the whole webpage
- head: Contains information about the page (not visible)
- title: Title shown on browser tab
- body: Contains all visible content
