            Rosa Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was an American civil rights movement activist best known
            for her refusal to move from her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, in defiance of Jim Crow
            racial-segregation laws. When Parks was arrested in 1955, local leaders were searching for a person who
            would be a good legal test case against segregation. She was deemed a suitable candidate, and the Women's
            Political Council (WPC) organized a one-day bus boycott on the day of her trial. After Parks was found
            guilty of violating state law, the boycott was extended indefinitely, lasting for 381 days and finally
            concluding after segregation on buses was deemed unconstitutional in the court case Browder v. Gayle. Parks
            received many awards and honors, both throughout her life and posthumously. She received the Presidential
            Medal of Freedom, a Congressional Gold Medal, and was also the first Black American to be memorialized in
            the National Statuary Hall.

        <section>There have been 16 governors of Bauchi State, in northeastern Nigeria, since it was created on 3
            February 1976 from part of the North-Eastern State. Bauchi has had alternating periods of military and
            civilian rule, with Colonel Mohammed Bello Kaliel as its first military governor (1976–1978). Civilian
            governance began in 1979 with Abubakar Tatari Ali of the National Party of Nigeria until a 1983 military
            coup. This was followed by a brief civilian regime from 1992 to 1993 under Dahiru Mohammed of the National
            Republican Convention, which was then toppled by a series of military governors and administrators that
            lasted until 1999. During this time, part of Bauchi was split off to form Gombe State in 1996. Democratic
            rule has continued in Bauchi since 1999, under Ahmadu Adamu Mu'azu from 1999 to 2007, Isa Yuguda from 2007
            to 2015, Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar (pictured) from 2015 to 2019, and the incumbent Bala Mohammed since
